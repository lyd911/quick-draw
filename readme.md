## Quick, Draw 

Using CNN model to do sketch recognition, based on Google quick draw dataset https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data, codes modified from https://github.com/akshaybahadur21/QuickDraw. This repo doesn't include dataset


### Dataset
You can either download from **BaiduNetDisk**(https://pan.baidu.com/s/1PAkFyH8EV-JES2zhB_5xBw) or from **Google Cloud Platform**(https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap)
I got `.npy` files from google cloud for 10 drawings ['candle', 'door', 'lightning', 'moon', 'mountain', 'shoes', 'sword', 't-shirt', 'telephone', 'train']


### Procedure

1) Get the dataset as mentioned above and place the `.npy` files in `/data` folder.
2) First, run `LoadData.py` which will load the data from the `/data` folder and store the features and labels in  pickel files.
3) Now you need to have the data, run `QD_trainer.py` which will load data from pickle and augment it. After this, the training process begins.
4) Now you need to have the data, run `QuickDrawApp.py` which will take the test file stored in source folder as the input.
